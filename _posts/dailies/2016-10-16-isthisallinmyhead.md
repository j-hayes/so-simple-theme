This line has been ringing in my head ever since I read it last week. As someone who reads and writes it is so powerful. It felt like such a heart felt thank you from J.K. to her readers. As if to say, yes this was all fiction, and it was in your head, but you let me in and we shared something real.

My response is "No, Thank YOU J.K.""

Full quote:

“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?”

Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure.

“Of course it’s happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
-J.K. Rowling
