I came upon a website with a host of wonderful interview based discussions of philosophy (the fist of which I came across was one on the nature of consciousness.) The website is called [Closer to the Truth](https://www.closertotruth.com) and originates from a PBS show. The specific set of videos I began watching is called [Are Science and Religion at War.](https://www.closertotruth.com/series/are-science-religion-war)

**Advice**: Watch the last video first. "Dialog between Science and Religion is worthwhile, a debate is not... They ask questions on different planes and the planes do not intersect." 

My overall take on these videos in aggregate is summed up well in passing by the host, Robert Lawrence Kuhn, in one of the videos. He says that at some level science and religion have understand that there are boundaries to their respective types of questions. This is not to say, however, that the boundaries are stagnant. Science is constantly pushing the boundaries of what we know or what we think we can know. Expanding on one of the ideas put forth by Saul Perlmutter I would say: The great thing about being an thinker, an academic is that we get to reanalyze how we view the universe every time we learn something new. When we learn more about how the universe **is**, we have to take what we thought about how the universe might be and see if it holds up to what we now know. 

I think when one watches all of these videos, my hope is that one can see that Science and Religion and faith do not need to be combative. 

Some interesting term I learned from this "God of the Gaps." Essentially it is looking for a proof of God based on our not being able understand or prove something in our physical universe. It was pointed out by one of the Christian interviewed, this is not the kind of God one should base their faith around or even argue for, as it doesn't align with Christian philosophy or theology, and it is just bad science. We are constantly filling in gaps in our understanding with science and reason. This kind of theology is going to end up being a moving target. 

On the flip side of things though the first interviewee Quentin Smith makes an inverse argument that is equally fallacious (basically a Argument from Personal Incredulity where the person is any person). The crux of his argument comes down to we cannot comprehend a God that is outside of the physical beings with a consciousness. That kind of God is to him incomprehensible, how would such a Being act on the universe. However, in a similar way he limits reality (and God) to what the human mind can comprehend.   

To his credit Quentin makes a very strong statement against many theists, the cherry picking of science. My thought is not to try to explain God through our own physical limitations. Sadly one needs to accept that metaphors are as far as far as one is going to get when talking about God. 

Hope these videos help orient conversations around the notions of a creative God and the physical world. My advice always when discussing these sorts of things in a group of people with mixed views (So really all the time) is to make sure assumptions are clearly defined in the conversation before going head strong into discourse.
