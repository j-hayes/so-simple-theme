A good primer to this post are the following two youtube videos. I had to watch them to get refresher on the plot-line. I am sensitive that most of us don't have time to sit down and read or re-read these books. (Although I would highly recommend both of them both because of cultural relevance and literary brilliance)

I was talking to a friend today about the absurdity of our current news cycle and my friend expressed his disblilef that the concept of "alternative facts" was something that a culture could stomach, that a denial of truth could go that far. I mistakenly said something to the effect of "Yes, we are living in a Orwellian nightmere, it is 1984." However, it has been a bit since I have read either 1984 or Brave New World, although they are two of my favorite books of all time. It the the article [My dad predicted Trump in 1985 â€“ it's not Orwell, he warned, it's Brave New World](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley) the author quotes his father who said: 

### "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture."

Culturally "The West" spent the better part of the last century fearful of totalitarianism and having our freedoms stripped from us. The truth was something we were not to have access to because information gives us power. 

While we were being so fearful of losing what we had, we forgot to head the warnings of those who knew that we had the power to destroy ourselves through what I would describe as descendance. We had defeated our demons and now sought to build a utopia. With science and technology we can build almost anything we desire. We build things and promote them regardless if they are good for us or one another. 

We uphold this "utopia" through buying and producing more and more stuff, and when it doesn't fulfil us we go find something else to blast the pleasure centers of our brains with our favorite "somas" (drugs, alcohol (also a drug), sex, tv, whatever garbage we can find on the internet). (I am not saying I am above any of this. I am an equal part cause and victim of this situation just like most everyone these days.) 

We don't live in a world where some totalitarian government wishes to control every aspect of our lives. But there is at least one part of these two books that is shared: the idea that facts become irrelevant to society one way or another. In 1984 the removal of facts (and the emergence of doublespeak) is done to control the mind and the will of every person. In Brave New World we made the facts irrelevant ourselves because they don't make people happy. 

Our world sees both of these types of disregard for truth today. We ignore truths because they are uncomfortable and would require us to be self sacrificial. In light of this distaste for truth we have a government and media that are willing to side step truth to get their agenda across. It is sometimes for power and control, other times wealth and gain.
