I have happened upon these two terms several times in reading (and failing to read) some Philosophy/Theology articles but either through my own density or through not finding good descriptions I didn't know what these two words mean. However, today I found a good description (the first Google result when googling Posteriori. Whatever)

The terms "a priori" and "a posteriori" are used primarily to denote the foundations upon which a proposition is known. A given proposition is knowable a priori if it can be known independent of any experience other than the experience of learning the language in which the proposition is expressed, whereas a proposition that is knowable a posteriori is known on the basis of experience. For example, the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried is a priori, and the proposition that it is raining outside now is a posteriori.

Even an idiot like me that doesn't know latin can know that it is raining outside.
