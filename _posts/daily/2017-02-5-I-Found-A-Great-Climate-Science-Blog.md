So I was prowling around the internet yesterday looking generally for a "mathy" explanation for the greenhouse effect. Basically like if you have x amount of CO<sub>2</sub> how much heat is going to be retained in a system. Although I knew that I wasn't going to be able to fully understand it. I want to be at least a little more knowledgeable. 

I don't know if I exactly got the original question I was hunting for. However, I did in fact find probably a bunch of information that I will be wanting and will be glad to have. 

[CO2 – An Insignificant Trace Gas? Part One](https://scienceofdoom.com/2009/11/28/co2-an-insignificant-trace-gas-part-one/)

This blog (with as usual an annoying title) The Science of Doom, has as its mission: 

"People interested in the science behind the climate stories we read about every day. People who want to learn. People who want to contribute to other people learning about climate science." -[About Page](https://scienceofdoom.com/about/)

My kind of blog, learning and helping others learn. I plan on reading through a bunch of this and will post some thoughts on it maybe, but definitely wanted to share. 

The main point of the article is to establish the totally accepted idea gases in our atmosphere do in fact cause the earth to be warmer than it would be and that CO<sub>2</sub>

### The article itself talks through a few things:  

- What temperature the eaaef=rth would be if the atmosphere was not absorbing any amount of solar radiation. (-18°C which is not what the actual average temperature on earth is. It is apx. 15°C) 
- How it is we can measure the radiation that is coming from earth and not just radiation bouncing straight off the earth. So that you can measure what is being absorbed. 
- At what wavelengths of radiation do certain compounds that make up earths atmosphere emit and absorb energy.
- At the end of the article goes into the basic math behind the amount of energy the sun produces and how much of it is directed at earth. 

### Conclusion: 

"The question asked at the start was “Is CO2 an insignificant trace gas?” and the answer is no.

CO2 and water vapor are very significant in the earth’s climate, otherwise it would be a very cold place.

What else can we conclude? Nothing really, this is just the starting point. It’s not a sophisticated model of the earth’s climate, it’s a “zero dimensional model” or “billiard ball model” which takes a very basic viewpoint and tries to establish the effect of the sun and the atmosphere on surface temperature. It does not look at feedback and it’s very simplistic.

Climate is a complex subject. Hopefully this explains some basics and we can start looking a little deeper in subsequent posts."

This is a really great starting point for me to dive deeper into understanding the drivers of climate, hope it helps you as well.
