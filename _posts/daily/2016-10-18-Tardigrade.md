If you are worried about all animal life on earth being destroyed by human's destruction of eco-systems, fear not.

Let me introduce you to the Tardigrade. No matter what sins we commit against our earth, these little guys will live on.

### Let's take a look at their stats:

They can survive: 
- A few minutes at 151 °C (304 °F)
- 30 years at −20 °C
- A few days at −200 °C (−328 °F)
- A few minutes at −272 °C (~1 K, −458 °F)

Let's talk about that last one, 1 K. If you take all of the matter that is around one of these little survivers and more ore less STOP ALL OF THE SUBATOMIC PARTICLES MOVING these guys will live on. 

Okay the mighty Tardigrade says, next challenge.

Well let's put them in the vacume of space. They say, hey that's fine go ahead and go on holiday, and pick me up after. Just make sure you back by **10 DAYS** from now. That involves living in a vacuum and incurring a lot of radiation. Some of these guys can take about 200 times more radiation than humans. 

Oh and back to presure. They can live in the vacuum of space, but you know if you want to cranck up the presure to 6000 earth atmosphers of presure, that's cool too. 

So yeah, I am impressed by these things. So what else can they do? Well they can live without water for like 10 years. A sprinkle of water and boom the wake back up and reproduce and keep the party going. 

They are found on almost every conceivable place on earth. They can withstand almost anything. Fear them. They will live on. You couldn't even go through a 3 hour flight without a gin and tonic.
