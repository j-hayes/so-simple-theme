Textbooks to me are a big part of how one learns a new subject. It's not my favorite way of learning, however they are typically packed with information and they also contain information that can't be found in my preferred way of learning these days, youtube videos. (Well at least not all the information that you need will be there). E-textbooks are also very portable and when downloaded don't require a connection to the internet, which is nice. 

Anyway here are a couple of good sites I have found so far. I will try to keep a running list of resources that I have used. 


### [Openstax](https://cnx.org/) 
This site has a bunch of introductory level textbooks. Your 101s of various subjects. The quality seems to be very high. I haven't dug into them deeply but I am impressed from what I have seen. 

### [This list](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2013/08/14/The-Price-is-Right-11-Excellent-Sites-for-Free-Digital-Textbooks.aspx?Page=1)

There are probably plenty more. Let me know if you know any particularly good ones and I will add them.
