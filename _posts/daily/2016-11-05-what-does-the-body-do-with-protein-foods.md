Protein, that stuff that makes up body builders muscles and egos. Protein, that stuff in your hamburger. Protein, that thing kids need to grow up big and strong. Protein, that word I want to spell "i" before "e" but a little squiggly line tells me otherwise. 

In my pursuit of learning more about human nutrition tonight, I began reading a nutrition textbook. The thing that struck me as most interesting in the first chapters was an aside comment. "There is no protein storage in the body..."  My immediate thought was, well then where the heck does it go if it isn't stored? I was curious about this, because in the American diet there is a tendency to over consume protein Almost double the recommended amount of ~50g per day for the average adult sedentary male. And let's face it, most of us are pretty darn sedentary.

So then what the heck is the body doing with that double quarter-pounder that you just inhaled or that mound of nuts you just munched on? 

Well it does several things apparently:

- It can break it down the amino acids into ammonia, nonessential amino acids, and other substances that are used at a molecular level or excreted in the form of urine if there is still an excess. (Read, you're gonna pee it out.) 
- It can be converted into glucose that can be burned as energy. 
  - However, if you already have eaten enough carbohydrates and sugars (and yes you probably have) it is either excreted as solid waste or after being converted to glucose, it will be stored as fat. 
  
 **The long and the short of it is, excess protein is essentially going to waste or onto your waist for most people.**
