# What does Demagogue Mean?

I have heard this word thrown around a lot lately in
 reference to our newly elected president.
  I didn't really have a good sense of the word other than it being a negative word
  to describe a political figure.

As always lets start with a quick dictionary definition.

Definition of demagogue
1) a leader who makes use of popular prejudices and false claims and promises in order to gain power
2) a leader championing the cause of the common people in ancient times

Okay there is a start, but not really, one of those seems great. I would love to be considered a champion of the common people (in modern times thought, I like my modern technology). The other is quite a different story, and more likely the definition we are looking for based on, oh I don't know, every thing that has happened in the last year.

Anyway after watching the following video which gives some historical context to the word, I do think the word is a pretty apt description of Trump. (please ignore the click-bait title.)  I

 The best tid bit of the video:

[Socrates] asked us to imagine an
election debate between two candidates, one who was like a doctor and the other who was
like a sweet shop owner. The sweet shop owner would say of his rival: Look, this person
here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you
not to eat and drink whatever you like. He’ll never serve you feasts of many and varied
pleasant things like I will. Socrates asks us to consider the audience response: Do you
think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer – ‘I cause you trouble,
and go against you desires in order to help you’ would cause an uproar among the voters,
don’t you think? We have forgotten all about Socrates’s salient warnings against democracy.
We have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good – rather than as something
that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it. As a result, we
have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors."

If you came here for a quick fix to your demagogue problem, I don't have one, sorry. However, I have a viewpoint on a long term solution.
The real solution to our demagogue problem is education. I do believe that it is a right of every citizen to elect their leaders. However, as with
any right, one has a duty to their fellow citizens to educate themselves and make decisions based on that education. (And going back to one of my core beliefs that we have a duty to, once having learned, to teach or share what one has learned.)

Anyway long story short we learned a new word today. Sorry that the learning got a little political.
