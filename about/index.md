# This blog is dedicated to learning, I try to do it always.

### Why I do it:
- If I document it, it will motivate me to do a more complete job of learning a topic. 
- What is the point of learning if it isn't used or shared. 
  - As I don't know how much of anything I learn will get used, it might as well be shared. My base level goal if nothing else is achieved is that I make it easier to learn something that someone already wanted to learn, or spark someone's interest in learning more about a topic. 

I can't give you much more detail other than that. If you still have questions about why I would want to spend so much time somewhat haphazardly learning seemingly random stuff and writing about it, you probably don't know me well. 

### Why no comments section?
Why would I want to subject myself to that. This is a safe space for me to share what I have found, share some opinions if I have them and feel like it. As much as it isn't in the spirit of learning, I am not looking to open dialog with this blog, at least not on the blog itself. 

Comments sections devolve into political, non-logic based pissing matches that I have no interest in. 

In short, fear. Sorry. 

### What this blog isn't 
This isn't my "personal" blog. That exists elsewhere. As such I will try as much as is appropriate to keep politics out of this blog. 
I want this to be a place of facts and reason. I will try to acheive this by keeping the topics fairly narrow. 

I may fail at this. Actually I will invariably fail. However, failure is part of learning. So that's probably good? What I will be doing consistently is giving my viewpoint on things. I'll be doing it Philosophically, but not politically, (hopefully).

For example: 
The classic open ended question of: 
"If a tree falls down in a forest, does it make a sound?"

My first opinion is that the question is stupid. (Obviously it isn't because people have been talking about it forever) The wording is unhelpful and causes problems. What are we defining as a sound. Are we talking about the subjective notion that a life form of some kind is picking out the sound waves and translating that to neural pathways and analyzing that information. Or do you mean does that  the tree interacts with air molecules as it falls and hits the ground which inturn makes more air molecules move about?

If it is the first option. No it didn't make a "sound." If it is the second yes it did make a "sound." 

Second question what do you define as a tree. Just kidding that would be annoying wouldn't it. I hope I don't have to question things at that level. 

This is all to demonstrate that I come from a baseline assumption that we live in an objective reality. One that has stuff in it that interacts with each other and is measurable and all that. This is the kind of opinion I might interject.
